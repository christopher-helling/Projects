         * General idea. we start with the first k values, e.g. k=4, m = [4,1,1,1]. The following facts are true after we populate our first k elements:
         * 1. The values can be no larger than k, e.g. in (0, 1, 2, ... k) by the pigeonhole principle. If we have m[0], m[1], ..., m[k-1] (k numbers), 
         * then m[k] is the smallest (min) number not among these. For m[k] > k, this would mean we ave every number from0 to k (k+1 numbers) here. Contradiction.
         * 2. Since we are only considering the previous k elements, and no element larger than k can appear in the previous k elements, we will see every number
         * from 0 to k represented from m[k] to m[2k]. I.e. we look at k elements at a time (the previous k elements), so after one cycle, every time we move our 
         * range of k elements, the element popped off is the next to add.
         * E.g. [3,1,4,1] 0, 2, 3, 4, 1 ; 0, 2, 3, 4, 1 ...
         * 3. Consequently, we are only interested in the first cycle of numbers to add (the 0,2,3,4,1 part). Furthermore, n will fall among these values, so when 
         * we want to find the nth element, we take it mod (k+1) (the cycle length from 0 to k), and we can stop computing once we have reached it.
         * 4. I used an array of -1's as a way to keep track of missing values without needing to sort. The number is represented by its index in the array (which
         * means it is already sorted from 0 to k), where a -1 means the value is in use, otherwise the value equals itself. This way I can quickly check the smallest
         * number not in use in the previous k elements by simply looping through this array and stopping at the first value > -1. E.g. for [3,1,4,1] --> [0, -1, 2, -1, -1].
         * 5. I used the Int32 datatype since CodeEval won't use huge inputs, but this should be refactored for larger inputs.
